JSCN
====

JSCN (JavaScript Configuration Notation) is a human readable dialect of JSON designed with config files in mind.  Inspired by [TOML](https://github.com/mojombo/toml).

Goals/Requirements
------------------

* Easier to read/write than standard JSON.
* Comments!
* Multi-line strings.
* The dialect should be forgiving enough to parse any JSON document with an object as a root element.
* Ability to deal with more data types later on.
